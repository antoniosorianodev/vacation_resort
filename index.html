            Miles of shoreline, dozens of resorts, French cuisine to die for – Tahiti has all the makings of a honeymoon
            destination. But beach bums often pass over Tahiti's sands in favor of Bora Bora's ivory shores. Despite its
            idyllic reputation and accessibility, Tahiti is often more of a stopover point en route to romantic getaways
            on
            smaller islands. However, that doesn't mean Tahiti should be ignored.

            Leafy forests sit beside sandy shores, while French crêpes are served alongside Tahitian poisson cru (raw
            fish).
            If there ever was a place that embodies the beautiful duality of the French Polynesian archipelago, it's
            Tahiti.
            Here, the quirky, often chaotic atmosphere of the island's capital, Papeete, rubs elbows with uncorrupted
            natural beauty.

            In fact, Tahiti – the largest of French Polynesia's 118 islands – is often referred to as two separate
            islands
            despite them being joined by a tiny land bridge. Tahiti Nui is the larger, northwestern section where
            Papeete
            can be found. Tahiti Iti (the smaller, southeastern half) is less accessible, although many visitors make
            the
            trek here for the seclusion. Just note that spending a week on either part of Tahiti will cost you quite a
            chunk
            of change. Regardless, travelers agree that the warm waters, lush jungles and luxurious resorts are worth
            the
            splurge.
